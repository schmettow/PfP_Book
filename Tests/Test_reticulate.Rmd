# Test Python chunks in Rmarkdown

```{r}
library(reticulate)
use_condaenv("base_2.7")
```

```{r}
print("R chunk")
```


```{python}
import sys
print(sys.version)
```

# Do separate chunks use the same Python session?

```{python}
a = 1
```

If this prints correctly, they do.

```{python}
print(a)
```

And Python variables can also be accessed from R

```{r}
print(py$a)
```

Unevaluated chunk

```{python eval = F}
print("You should not see output from this")
```

Chunk with Python error

```{python error = TRUE} 
print(1.0/0)
```

Chunk with Python syntax error

```{python eval = F} 
quote = "Freud: "The mind is like an iceberg, it floats with one-seventh of its bulk above water.""
```
