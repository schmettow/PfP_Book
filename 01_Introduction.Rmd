## Installing Python

<!-- #9 use conda environments -->

1.	From https://www.anaconda.com/download/ download the 64-bit installer  of Python 2.7 
2.	Run the downloaded file and 
    a.	Install for “just me”
    b.	Accept  the proposed destination folder
    c.	Accept default advanced options
3.	In the start menu find the program Anaconda Prompt
4.	In the console, type: `conda install –c cogsci pygame` and hit Return. Confirm with y

For testing your Anaconda environment, follow these steps:

1.	From the Start menu start Anaconda Navigator
1.  From the Home screen launch Spyder
2.	Download the Python file PIP_Stroop_interaction.py from the folder Week 1 on Google Drive https://goo.gl/UmBsil
3.	Open this file in Spyder (File --> Open).
4.	Run the program by clicking the green play button. You should see a window popping up, which greets you to the Stroop experiment.


And finally, it is a dear tradition to greet the world with your first program. Create a new file in Spyder and copy-paste the following lines into it. Then hit the play button once again.


```{python}
x = 'hello, python world!'
print(x.split(' '))
```



## Computers are dumb {#dumb_computers}

Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer. The problem is … computers are incredibly dumb. In order to get used to instructing dumb computers, in the following exercise YOU will become the computer yourself. You will not just be the computer, you first have to program it, complying to some debilitating set of communication rules. 

Your task is to create a theater play that resembles a computer to execute a program that Psychology researchers have used a thousand times in their labs. In the *Stroop task*, participants are shown a word that is written to the screen in one of three ink colors (red, blue, green). They are asked to name the ink color as quick as possible, usually by pressing one of four assigned keys (e.g., Y = red, X = blue, N = green). The task has a twist: the presented words are themselves color words. It can happen that the word "RED" appears in red ink, which we call the *congruent condition*, but it can also happen that the word "BLUE" appears in green letters, which is *incongruent*. Hundreds of experiments have shown, that in the incongruent condition people respond noticably slower. This observation is called the *Stroop effect* and dozens of theories have spawned from this observation. Discussing them is beyond the scope, but to not let you completely dissatisfied: people seem to always read the words, although they were not asked to do so and we can conclude:

1. people cannot *not* read
1. people do not (always) listen to what an experimenter wants from them

The following exercise is meant as a theater play and thus works best for a team of around 7-8 students. However, nothing keeps you from just being a drama poet and put down a script all by yourself.

Here are the rules for the theater play:

1. every actor (except the looper, see below) can only perform one simple action

2. actors can only talk to the looper, but not to each other

3. every actor can
    a)	either do something on command 
    b)	or answer a question

4. actors who take commands 
    a)	only understand one command, like “pick a color”
    b)	can only do one thing, like 
        * picking an object
        * showing an object
        * making a particular change to an object

    c)	in addition they can give and receive objects from the looper

5.	actors who answer questions 
    a)	only understand one question type, for example: “What time is it now?”
    b)	can only give a one-word answer, for example:
      *	a word from a predefined set of words
      * a number
      * yes or no (as a special case of a pedefined set)

6.	The *looper* is a special actor who
    a)	is the only one can interact with other actors (speak, listen, exchange objects) and knows all the possible questions, answers and actions the other actors can perform.
    b) is slightly more intelligent than the other actors in that he/she can make decisions by combining information from various sources.
    c)	can do simple calculations (like subtracting a number) and comparisons (like comparing two colors).
    e) unfortunately has no senses, but relies completely on what the actors tell
    f)	speaks a continuous monologue to the audience, explaining all  actions to the audience.

8. the *drawer* is a special actor whose task it is to present output to the user.

9. the *event handler* is a special actor whose task it is to take input from the user

10.	the *user* is a special actor who only interacts with *drawer* and *event handler*.



For the play you will need the following requisites:

1.	these instructions
2.	three color word stencils
3.	three ink colors (to put behind the stencil)
4.	a button bar with three 
5.	a timer that starts at 00:00:00 when the play begins and counts minutes and seconds continuously. You can use a smartphone for this purpose. Or you assign an actor who just counts up.
6.	paper and pencil

It is further recommended that one of the team is assigned the role of the *debugger*. This person does not take an active role, but watches over the compliance with the set of rules. 

Have fun and do not let your intuition come between you and the task!



## Dive in: a first example 

In section 1.2 [Computers are dumb], you have seen how debilitating it can be to program a computer to do the simplest things. Talking to a computer (as a programmer) requires to understand some fundamental ways of how computers work and learn their language. A good way to get started learning a language is just go there and expose yourself to native speakers. Let's do that! The following text is a program the performs the Stroop task, just as in the theater play. 

```{python eval = FALSE}

```

At first sight, you'll probably see just gargle-bargle. But on closer examination, you may see one or the other thing you recognize.  We start with the most visible feature of the Stroop task, colors. If you watch out for color words in the code, you'll find the following: 

```{python eval = FALSE}
col_white = (250, 250, 250)
col_black = (0, 0, 0)
col_gray = (220, 220, 220)
col_red = (250, 0, 0)
col_green = (0, 200, 0)
col_blue = (0, 0, 250)

COLORS   = {"red": col_red,
            "green": col_green,
            "blue": col_blue}

WORDS    = ("red", "green", "blue")
```

The first paragraph defines each color used throughout the program as three numbers. This is because computer screens produce all colors by mixture of red, blue and green, which not coincidentily matches the three types of color vision sensors in our eyes. For example, black just means that all lights are out, hence the three zeroes. Red means that only the red channel is firing photons. 

Whenever you see a single `=` character, that means that what is given to the right is stored in a *variable* to the  left. The second paragraph just collects the three colors in one compound variable, which you will later learn to be a *dictionary*. Search for `COLOR` in the following code to see, how it is being used:

```{python eval = FALSE}

def draw_stimulus(color, word):
    text_surface = font.render(word, True, COLORS[color], col_gray)
    text_rectangle = text_surface.get_rect()
    text_rectangle.center = (SCREEN_SIZE[0]/2.0,150)
    screen.blit(text_surface, text_rectangle)

```
This code block is called a *function definition*. This function almost exactly represents what one of the actors did in the play: receiving a color word and a color, combine it into one Stroop trial and show it to the user. We can follow up how this function is used, by searching for "draw_stimulus" in the code:

```{python eval = FALSE}
if STATE == "present_trial":
            draw_stimulus(this_color, this_word)
            draw_button(SCREEN_SIZE[0]*1/5, 450, "Red: X", col_red)
            draw_button(SCREEN_SIZE[0]*3/5, 450, "Green: N", col_green)
            draw_button(SCREEN_SIZE[0]*4/5, 450, "Blue: M", col_blue)
```

What you see here is a so-called *conditional*. Only the most simple program are just a sequence of procedures. All "real" programs, and especially *interactive programs*, do certain things only when certain conditions are satisfied. Here the condition is that the current *state* of the program is to present a trial. If you look further around you will immediatly see that the variable `STATE` is used all over the place and it happens to always occur in one of two patterns in the code:

1. as a condition (`STATE == ...`)
2. as an assignment of new values (`STATE = ...`)

Note the difference between `=`, which stores a new value in a variable and `==` which means *equals*. Let's discover where the variable `STATE` actually gets such a value: `"present_trial"`:

```{python eval = FALSE}
if STATE == "feedback":
    if event.type == KEYDOWN and event.key == K_SPACE:
        if trial_number < 20:
            STATE = "present_trial"
        else:
            STATE = "goodbye"
        print(STATE)

```

Literally, this reads as: "If we are in state 'feedback' (where the participant is shown the results of the previous trial), and if the space key is pressed, and if we have not yet reached the maximum number of trials, then present the next trial (otherwise say good bye)"

These are precisely the rules the looper in our play had to have on her mind. If you look closely, you will find more of similar constructions, that change the state under certain conditions. These statements we later call *interaction conditionals*, and they control the flow of the program. This is why they are more complicated than the rest.

As a final endeavour, we try to find some clues how the measurement of *response time* is handled in the program. If you serach for "time", the first occurence is right at the top:

```{python eval = FALSE}
from time import time
```

Just as programmers can define functions, they can also make use of functions other programmers are already providing. Usually, they do so in larger packages of related functions, which are called *libraries*. This line of code means: from the library time, make available the function time. Where is this function used?

```{python eval = FALSE}
if STATE == "present_trial":
    trial_number = trial_number + 1
    this_word  = pick_color()
    this_color = pick_color()
    time_when_presented = time()
    STATE = "wait_for_response"
```

The only thing that happens here, is that in the moment where the trial is presented, the current absolute time is recorded in a variable `time_when_presented`. How is that used further down?

```{python eval = FALSE}
if STATE == "wait_for_response":
    if event.type == KEYDOWN and event.key in KEYS.values():
        time_when_reacted = time()
        this_reaction_time = time_when_reacted - time_when_presented
        this_correctness = (event.key == KEYS[this_color])
        STATE = "feedback"
```

When the user responds by pressing a button, that moment in time is recorded in another variable `time_when_reacted` and the current reaction time is computed as the time difference between reaction and presentation.

## Exercises

1. Load the Stroop program into your Python editor and run it yourself.
2. Find further function definitions that resemble one of the actors in the play
3. If you have struggled with recording the response time in a compliant way, how would you do it, now that you have seen how the code works? How many actors are needed, and what precisely can they do?
4. Change the program such that it does 8 trials
5. Change the progran such that it uses orange instead of red (words and colors)
6. Change the program such that it uses Q, W, E as response keys
7. Change the program such that it performs the Stroop task with four words and colors
